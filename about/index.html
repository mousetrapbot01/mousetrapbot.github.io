	and have plans to pursue a degree further increase my knowledge. </p>
<p> Some competitions I have partaken in are:
	<br/> AMC/AIME
	<br/> ARML
	<br/> Duke Math Meet
	<br/> Johns Hopkins Math Tournament </p>

<p> Courses that I have taken include:
	<br/> Differential Equations 
	<br/> Linear Algebra
